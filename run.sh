# ---- Qt platform plugin + RHI backend ----
# Hard-won lessons from runtime testing on this host:
#   1. On Wayland sessions, older Qt/driver stacks rendered a black window
#      for QOpenGLWidget children under the native Wayland plugin; the XCB
#      plugin (via XWayland) is the reliable path → default QT_QPA_PLATFORM
#      to xcb. Any user override is respected.
#   2. Known cost of the xcb/XWayland path: while ANOTHER window is
#      fullscreen, animated views stutter until that window closes. Native
#      Wayland does not have this problem — try QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
#      ./run.sh if you hit it (also printed to the terminal at launch).
#      Newer Qt/driver stacks no longer black-screen there.
#   3. Qt 6 may default to the Vulkan RHI backend on this GPU and produce a
#      black viewport; force OpenGL with QSG_RHI_BACKEND=opengl.
